# Grimoire - The Hand-Drawn Programming Language

> "Every Program is a Spell"

Grimoire is an experimental programming language where code is written by drawing magic circles. Programs are created through hand-drawn geometric patterns that are compiled via image recognition.

## 🌟 Features

- **Visual Programming**: Write code by drawing magic circles, runes, and geometric patterns
- **Image Recognition**: Compile hand-drawn or digital images into executable programs
- **Symbolic Logic**: Each shape and symbol has semantic meaning
- **Topology-Based Flow**: Program flow is determined by the connections between shapes

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Compile a Grimoire program
grimoire compile circle.png -o circle.exe

# Run with interpreter
grimoire run circle.png

# Debug mode with visual feedback
grimoire debug circle.png
```

## 📋 Requirements

- Image files: PNG, JPG, or hand-drawn scans
- Minimum resolution: 300x300 pixels
- Clear, high-contrast drawings recommended

## 🔮 Example

A simple "Hello World" in Grimoire:

```
    ○ (main circle)
    |
    □ (output box)
    |
"Hello World" (text in quotes)
```
